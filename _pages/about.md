I'm a Masters student at EPFL, studying *Data Science* with a minor in Financial Engineering. I've worked on some interesting projects, like developing *AI platforms* and machine learning models, and have experience as a data scientist at Atos and a machine learning engineer at an EdTech EPFL startup. I love tackling complex problems, especially those involving *remote sensing, NLP and AI*. 

Outside of work, I enjoy *cycling*, *taking pictures* and *flying drones* (though I sometimes crash them). I also lead *student-run projects and entrepreneurial ventures*, always looking for new challenges to put my skills to the test!
