This research focuses on the explainability and transferability of handwriting features to improve the interpretability of machine learning models used in educational and clinical settings. By leveraging a dataset of childrenâ€™s handwriting and curated drawings, we developed features such as density, stroke durations and pauses, stops within a stroke, circular and vertical line regressions, stroke size clustering, and jerk. These features showed significant predictive power in distinguishing between good and bad handwriting, and many were also successfully transferable to graphical tasks like drawing.
