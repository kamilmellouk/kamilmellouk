This project investigates the correlation dynamics in cryptocurrency markets using high-frequency intraday data from Binance. By applying eigenvalue clipping, rolling window correlation, and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model, the analysis highlights the temporal interdependence between major cryptocurrencies. Changepoint detection techniques, including the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, identify key structural breaks in the market. The findings reveal persistent correlations between pairs like BTC and ETH and show how volatility impacts these relationships.
