This project assignment was was implemented with the help of 2 classmates for the course [DH2642 - Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2642?l=en) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](kth.se).

It consists of a city guessing game, somewhere between [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/): the user needs to find a mystery city using a limited number of guesses. Each new guess gives the player information on how the city he guessed compares to the one he needs to find.
