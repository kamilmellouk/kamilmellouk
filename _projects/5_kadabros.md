This project, completed by the Kadabros team for the CS401 Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL, explores the dynamics and evolution of YouTube’s "People & Blogs" category from 2006 to 2019. The analysis focuses on understanding how subcategories within "People & Blogs" have evolved, how channels leverage subcategory trends, and the impact of transitioning into or out of this category on a channel's popularity. We utilized the YouNiverse dataset provided by Manoel Horeira.

The study aims to uncover when and why channels shifted into the "People & Blogs" category and how such shifts impacted their audience engagement and overall popularity. A key focus is the evolution of the Vlog subcategory, analyzing factors such as video length, views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
