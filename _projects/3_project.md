Developed a machine learning model to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments using a balanced dataset of 2.5 million tweets. Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and traditional machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Advanced models were built using deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), incorporating GloVe embeddings for semantic understanding. Achieved a final accuracy of 85.8% using a Bidirectional LSTM.
